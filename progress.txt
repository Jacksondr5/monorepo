## Codebase Patterns
- Use `pnpm nx generate @nx/next:application` to create new Next.js apps
- Apps follow the pattern of: package.json (with workspace deps), tsconfig.json (with ~/\* paths), project.json (with dev and vercel targets)
- Dark mode styling uses bg-slate-900 text-slate-100
- Convex backend lives in apps/<app>/convex/ with its own tsconfig.json
- Styles: create src/styles/global.css importing tailwindcss and component-library globals
- PostCSS: use @tailwindcss/postcss plugin
- next.config.ts uses composePlugins with withNx

## 2026-01-25 - US-001
- Created Next.js application at apps/trade-tracker/
- Initialized Convex backend at apps/trade-tracker/convex/ with empty schema
- Created dark mode layout.tsx with bg-slate-900 text-slate-100
- Created placeholder home page at src/app/page.tsx
- Build and lint pass successfully

**Files created/changed:**
- apps/trade-tracker/package.json
- apps/trade-tracker/project.json
- apps/trade-tracker/tsconfig.json
- apps/trade-tracker/next.config.ts
- apps/trade-tracker/postcss.config.mjs
- apps/trade-tracker/.swcrc
- apps/trade-tracker/eslint.config.mjs
- apps/trade-tracker/index.d.ts
- apps/trade-tracker/next-env.d.ts
- apps/trade-tracker/public/.gitkeep
- apps/trade-tracker/public/favicon.ico
- apps/trade-tracker/src/app/layout.tsx
- apps/trade-tracker/src/app/page.tsx
- apps/trade-tracker/src/styles/global.css
- apps/trade-tracker/convex/schema.ts
- apps/trade-tracker/convex/tsconfig.json

**Learnings for future iterations:**
- The nx generator creates next.config.js by default; convert it to next.config.ts for consistency
- tsconfig.json needs to include convex/**/*.ts in the include array
- Reference the component-library in tsconfig.json references array
- The schema.ts can be empty initially (defineSchema({})) - it will be populated in later stories
