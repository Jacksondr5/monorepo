# Convex guidelines

## Query guidelines

- Do NOT use `filter` in queries. Instead, define an index in the schema and use `withIndex` instead.
- Convex queries do NOT support `.delete()`. Instead, `.collect()` the results, iterate over them, and call `ctx.db.delete(row._id)` on each result.
- Use `.unique()` to get a single document from a query. This method will throw an error if there are multiple documents that match the query.
- When using async iteration, don't use `.collect()` or `.take(n)` on the result of a query. Instead, use the `for await (const row of query)` syntax.

### Ordering

- By default Convex always returns documents in ascending `_creationTime` order.
- You can use `.order('asc')` or `.order('desc')` to pick whether a query is in ascending or descending order. If the order isn't specified, it defaults to ascending.
- Document queries that use indexes will be ordered based on the columns in the index and can avoid slow table scans.

## Mutation guidelines

- Use `ctx.db.replace` to fully replace an existing document. This method will throw an error if the document does not exist.
- Use `ctx.db.patch` to shallow merge updates into an existing document. This method will throw an error if the document does not exist.
