# PR Creation Workflow

## Pre-Commit Checklist

1. **Verify you're not on main branch** - If you are, create a new branch (ideally with the Linear issue name if you have one)
2. **Run formatter** - BEFORE YOU COMMIT, run `pnpm nx format` from the root of the monorepo. Run the command EXACTLY AS IS, do not pass it any other args.
3. **Run verification checks** - Ensure code quality before committing:
   ```bash
   pnpm nx affected --parallel 8 -t typecheck lint
   ```

## Branch Naming Convention

Use the Linear issue branch name when available (found in Linear ticket details):

- Format: `jackson/jac-XX-descriptive-name`
- Example: `jackson/jac-76-replace-with-component-library-textarea-in-hackathon`

## Commit Message Format

Follow conventional commits format with Linear issue reference:

```
<type>: <description>

<body with bullet points of changes>

Fixes JAC-XX
```

**Example:**

```
feat: replace temporary textarea with component library Textarea

- Replace temporary textarea implementation with @jacksondr5/component-library Textarea
- Add proper dataTestId prop for consistent testing
- Update all Storybook stories to use test IDs instead of placeholder text
- Remove TODO comment

Fixes JAC-76
```

## Creating the PR

1. **Push the branch:**

   ```bash
   git push origin <branch-name>
   ```

2. **Create PR with GitHub CLI:**
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "<type>: <description> (JAC-XX)" --body "<PR description>"
   ```

## Notes

- Always run formatter before committing to avoid CI failures
- Verify all checks pass locally before pushing to avoid failed CI builds
