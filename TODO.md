# Hire

- Add more robust error handling to API calls
- Add proper checks for data ownership when making changes
- Ensure DB calls are optimized properly per the Convex way of doing things
- Lint is missing
- Find a way to handle the fact that organization ID is technically nullable. This causes annoying null checks throughout the app.

# Monorepo

- Nx inferred tasks seem to randomly disappear. Need to make a way to validate the task graph against an expected state
