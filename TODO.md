# Hire

- Add more robust error handling to API calls
- Add proper checks for data ownership when making changes
- Ensure DB calls are optimized properly per the Convex way of doing things
- Lint is missing

# Monorepo

- Nx inferred tasks seem to randomly disappear. Need to make a way to validate the task graph against an expected state
