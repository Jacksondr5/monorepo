# E2E Testing Plan for Hackathon App

This document outlines the plan for implementing an End-to-End (E2E) and component testing solution for the Hackathon application, utilizing Playwright and Storybook.

## Testing Goals

- Ensure core user flows function as expected.
- Verify individual UI components render and behave correctly in various states.
- Catch regressions early in the development cycle.
- Improve overall application quality and stability.
- Incorporate accessibility (a11y) checks.

## Tools

- **Clerk:** For Identity Provider (IdP) and authentication.
- **Convex:** For backend and database, including a data seeding function for tests.
- **GitHub Actions:** For CI/CD integration.
- **Playwright:** For E2E browser automation and interaction testing.
- **Storybook:** For UI component development, testing, and documentation.
- **Vercel:** For preview deployments that will trigger test runs.

## Plan Checklist

- [ ] **1. Verify Setup & Configuration:** Ensure Playwright and Storybook are correctly installed and configured within the monorepo.
- [ ] **2. Create Test Cases from User Stories:** Analyze `user_stories.md` to define comprehensive test scenarios. Document these cases in `test_cases.md`.
- [ ] **3. Determine Storybook vs. Playwright Cases:** Categorize each test case as suitable for Storybook (component-level, visual states) or Playwright (E2E flows, interactions).
- [ ] **4. Develop Convex Data Seeding Function:** Create a Convex function to seed necessary data (e.g., test users, projects) for consistent test execution in preview environments.
- [ ] **5. Add `data-testids`:** Implement `data-testid` attributes on all relevant HTML elements to ensure robust and maintainable test selectors.
- [ ] **6. Build Storybook Tests (with a11y checks):**
    - [ ] Develop Storybook stories for individual UI components.
    - [ ] Incorporate accessibility (a11y) checks using Storybook addons (e.g., `addon-a11y`).
- [ ] **7. Build Playwright Page Object Models (POMs):** Create POMs for different pages/sections of the application to enhance test readability and maintainability.
- [ ] **8. Build Playwright Test Scripts (with a11y checks):**
    - [ ] Write Playwright test scripts to automate user flows identified in the test cases.
    - [ ] Integrate accessibility checks (e.g., using `axe-core` with Playwright).
- [ ] **9. CI/CD Integration:** Configure GitHub Actions to trigger Playwright tests automatically when Vercel emits the `deployment_status` event for preview deployments.
